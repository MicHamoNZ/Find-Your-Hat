## Features Implemented

- **Field Class**: Implemented a `Field` class that represents the game field. It includes methods to set up the field, print its current state, validate player movements, and generate a randomized field with a hat and holes.

- **User Input and Movement**: Integrated user input functionality to allow players to indicate which direction they'd like to move in the field.

- **Game Loop and Game Over Handling**: Implemented a game loop that continuously prompts the player for input until the game is won or lost. Added handling for game over scenarios, such as displaying a message and allowing the player to restart the game.

## Next Steps

- **Improvements and Additions**: Consider adding features like multiple levels, scoring, or additional obstacles to make the game more challenging and engaging.

- **Bug Fixes**: Address any bugs or issues reported by users to improve the overall gameplay experience.
